#
### Getting Started
1\. First of all you need to clone Movie-quotes repository from github:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedberryInternship/ivane-movie-quotes.git
```

2\. Next step requires you to run *composer install* in order to install all the dependencies.
```sh
composer install
```

3\. after you have installed all the PHP dependencies, it's time to install all the JS dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

and also:
```sh
npm run dev
```
in order to build and watch your JS/tailwind resources.

---

And now you should provide **.env** file all the necessary environment variables:

#
**MYSQL:**
>DB_CONNECTION=mysql\
>DB_HOST=127.0.0.1\
>DB_PORT=3306\
>DB_DATABASE=***** \
>DB_USERNAME=***** \
>DB_PASSWORD=*****

#

##### Now, you should be good to go!

#
### Migration
if you've completed getting started section, then migrating database if fairly simple process, just execute:
```sh
php artisan migrate
```

#
### Development

You can run Laravel's built-in development server by executing:

```sh
  php artisan serve
```

when working on JS and tailwind you may run:

```sh
  npm run dev
```
it builds your js files into executable scripts.
It also watches and generates your tailwind properties in app.css

#
### Creation Of Administrator

in order to create an administrator you need to run:

```sh
  php artisan create:admin
```

after this, you need to generate a username:

```sh
  username
```
and password:

```sh
  ******
```

### Project Structure

```bash
├─── app
│   ├─── Console
│   ├─── Exceptions
│   ├─── Http
│   ├─── Providers
│   │... Models
├─── bootstrap
├─── config
├─── database
├─── public
├─── resources
├─── routes
├─── storage
├─── tests
├─── vendor
- .env
- artisan
- composer.json
- package.json
- phpunit.xml
- tailwind.config.js
- vite.config.js
```

Project structure is fairly straitforward(at least for laravel developers)...
